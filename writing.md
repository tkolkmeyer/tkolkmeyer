# The Original Purpose of the Hyperlink
_The eccentric and lofty goals held by the creator of the hyperlink_

I don't remember why I needed to google the "history of the hyperlink," but I'm deeply intrigued with what I found. The man who coined the term “hyperlink” had a massive vision for what links could be and what they were meant to do.

Hyperlinks were intended to be a tool that facilitated multiple connections between every piece of literature known to humankind. Wikipedia's one-way links fall so short of the lofty, esoteric end goal of infinitely linked literature that motivated him to develop hyperlinks.

So imagine an interface that is a scrollable carousel of an endless stack of deliberately organized papers. To swipe through would be to pull the next page out of the boundless stack and into focus. Each piece of literature is placed with the writing that inspired it and the writing that was inspired by it. Can you imagine?

For example, the original publication of The Trial would be preceded by the books Franz Kafka read as a youth, followed by the editor notes of his published work as an adult, alongside connections to every reference his own literature makes to other literature, in addition to all the literature that references his.

So the contemporary commentary, translations, impressions, poems, and criticisms of every piece of literature would exist together in a sort of chronological cyberspace library meant to capture all of humankind's inherited knowledge.

I begged an AI image generator to create a representation of this scholarly, LSD-inspired, poetry-repository thing, but the glitchy blue paper swarm featured above was its best attempt.
If you would like to learn about something interesting and strange while procrastinating whatever you're supposed to be doing—you could do way worse than googling "Ted Nelson Project Xanadu 1964."

Is this idea something that could bring an element of humanity to information architecture that the internet needs, or is it too far up the ivory towers to take seriously? I can't decide.

# An Apprentice's Plea
_An argument for clarity over brevity_

I printed my first “Hello World!” to the console using JavaScript around this time last year. Throughout my LaunchCode education and this apprenticeship that followed, I have found that the most difficult part of my coding journey has been processing complexity.

For example, when I was studying English in college, it wouldn’t have been acceptable to present a new theory on a text that I hadn’t read front to back and didn’t fully understand. When I add a feature to a codebase that sometimes works in mysterious ways, it feels like I am doing exactly that.

I think this part of my coding journey could be made easier if I could find ONE CSS class!!!

So please, regard my plea. Stop using SCSS to write class names in that strange, choppy, nested way; they can’t be searched for by their names within your IDE and don’t reflect how they are rendered in your browser’s dev tools. It drives me nuts.

Just for fun— here are those same classes, but placed beside their parents and stretched out to their full names (in exception to the “after” pseudo class).
