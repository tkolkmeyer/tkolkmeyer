# The Original Purpose of the Hyperlink
_The eccentric and lofty goals held by the creator of the hyperlink_

Hyperlinks as they’re used today provide a one-way route from the page you’re on to another page. They’re not all that hyper, it’s a pretty simple thing. We usually just call them links.

The man who coined the term “hyperlink” had a much bigger vision for what they could be and what they were meant to do. Ted Nelson launched Project Xanadu in 1964 with the goal of creating a “hypertext model” that would serve as a digital repository of human knowledge. The project aimed to create a system superior to the World Wide Web by maintaining an interface of documents connected according to the influence each publication had on each other.

If a user of Project Xanadu pulled up a passage from the Bible, for example, they would have access to a scrollable reel of documents that contain every known reference (exact quote or theme) to that particular passage. This reel of documents would exist as an endless stack of pages floating in hyperspace, with each document stacked conveniently alongside the literature that inspired it and the literature that followed.

So yes, links originally were meant to be part of an easy-to-use interface that would give one the ability to scroll through a collection of the inherited knowledge of humankind. Although it's true links do serve the purpose of making information accessible, the organization of modern link usage is not quite as esoteric.

Although fascinating, one may wonder what the cost is of developing such an interface, or the labor from deciding how _all_ documents are connected. Well, it's potentially not possible. Project Xanadu has gone bankrupt many times and has yet to be completed.

The usefulness of the hyperlink lives on despite the orignal hypertext project's failure. The modern use of the hyperlink is driven by the needs of business and the efficiency of engineers, rather than the fancy of philosophers. Hyperlinks are now one-way connections implemented however the copywriter sees fit, and organized however search engines seek to designate.
